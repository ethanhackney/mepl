sort hash chains
        NOTE: never mind that makes growing the table slower
        do tests to see if its worth it
check saved hashes before string compares
        if they dont have the same hash, they cant be the same key

use some kind of randomized hash to avoid denial of service

remember that you can hash anything, you could use a struct as a key
by just hashing each of its fields and adding those together

if things are multithreaded then try to keep the current table available to
threads while you are growing the new table

tab = alloc new tab

maybe try quadratic probing, but im not optimistic about it
